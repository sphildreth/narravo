# Copilot Instructions Setup Summary

This document summarizes the GitHub Copilot instructions that have been set up for the Narravo project.

## Files Created/Updated

### 1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (NEW)
Comprehensive GitHub Copilot instructions tailored to the Next.js/TypeScript tech stack:
- Project overview and tech stack details
- Code style and TypeScript configuration guidelines
- React/Next.js patterns and best practices
- Database and API design principles
- File organization structure
- Development guidelines for components, state, error handling, performance, security
- Testing strategies
- Common patterns and code examples
- Specific constraints for database, authentication, content security, caching

### 2. `docs/AGENTS.md` (UPDATED)
Updated the automation guide to reflect the actual Next.js tech stack:
- Changed scope from .NET/Blazor to React/Next.js components
- Updated constraints for PostgreSQL/Drizzle instead of EF Core/SQLite
- Modified project structure to match current app/ directory layout
- Updated verification commands to use pnpm instead of dotnet
- Added task templates for React components and Next.js patterns

### 3. `docs/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` (NEW)
Created a prompt template specifically for Next.js development:
- Project context with correct tech stack
- Appropriate constraints for TypeScript/React/PostgreSQL
- Updated verification commands
- Proper file paths and structure references

### 4. `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` (UPDATED)  
Enhanced the contributing guide with comprehensive information:
- Detailed tech stack overview
- Complete development setup instructions
- Code style and quality guidelines
- Testing information
- Database change workflow
- Commit and PR guidelines
- Verification commands

### 5. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` (NEW)
Created a practical development guide with:
- Quick reference for common commands
- Code patterns and examples for Next.js App Router
- Server Actions implementation patterns
- Database query examples using Drizzle ORM
- Component patterns with TypeScript
- Testing patterns
- Environment variable documentation
- Debugging tips and performance best practices

## Tech Stack Alignment

The instructions now properly reflect the actual technology stack:

**Before (Incorrect)**: .NET, C#, Blazor, EF Core, SQLite, Razor Pages
**After (Correct)**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, React 18, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, Server Actions

## Key Features of the Setup

1. **Type Safety Focus**: Emphasizes strict TypeScript configuration with proper null checking
2. **Next.js Best Practices**: Server Components, App Router, proper caching strategies
3. **Database Guidelines**: PostgreSQL-first with Drizzle ORM abstractions
4. **Security Requirements**: HTML sanitization, input validation, CSRF protection
5. **Performance Guidelines**: Efficient caching, minimal client-side JavaScript
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements
7. **Testing Strategy**: Vitest + React Testing Library patterns

## Verification

The setup maintains compatibility with existing project structure and commands:
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ Dependencies install correctly
- ⚠️ Some pre-existing TypeScript strict mode violations in tests (unrelated to this setup)

## Usage

Developers and AI assistants can now reference:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for comprehensive coding guidelines
- `docs/AGENTS.md` for automation-safe tasks and constraints
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for practical development patterns
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution workflow
- `docs/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` for structured feature requests

This setup ensures that GitHub Copilot and other AI coding assistants understand the project's architecture, constraints, and best practices specific to the Next.js/TypeScript implementation.
