# Upload and Featured Image Troubleshooting Guide

This document explains how to diagnose and fix issues with uploading featured images and post images in production.

## Overview

The application has comprehensive logging to help diagnose permission and upload issues. To enable debug logging in production, set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## Upload Flow

### 1. Featured Image Upload (Post Creation/Editing)

**Flow:**
1. User selects featured image in post editor
2. Form submits with `featuredImageFile` as File object
3. Server action (`createPost` or `updatePost`) processes the file
4. File is saved to storage (S3/R2 or local filesystem)
5. Database record is updated with `featuredImageUrl`

**Log Points:**
- `[createPost]` / `[updatePost]` - Initial processing
- `[createPost] Processing featured image upload:` - File details logged
- `[createPost] Uploading to cloud storage (S3/R2):` or `[createPost] Uploading to local storage:` - Storage method chosen
- `[createPost] Cloud upload successful:` or `[createPost] Local upload successful:` - Upload completed
- `[createPost] Post created successfully with ID:` - Database update completed
- `[createPost] Error uploading featured image:` - Upload failed (check error details)

**Files:**
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/posts/actions.ts` - Server actions with logging

### 2. Editor Image Upload (Drag/Drop or Insert)

**Flow:**
1. User drops image or clicks "Image" button in editor
2. Editor calls `/api/r2/sign` to get upload credentials
3. Editor uploads file to signed URL (S3/R2) or `/api/uploads/local`
4. Upload is tracked in database as "temporary"
5. When post is saved, `commitUploadsForPost` marks images as "committed"

**Log Points:**
- `[/api/r2/sign] POST request received` - Sign request initiated
- `[/api/r2/sign] Request - filename:` - File details logged
- `[/api/r2/sign] No S3/R2 config found, using local storage` - Local storage fallback
- `[/api/r2/sign] S3/R2 config found, generating presigned URL` - Cloud storage selected
- `[/api/r2/sign] Generated local upload policy` or `Generated presigned URL` - Credentials created
- `[/api/uploads/local] POST request received` - Local upload started (if using local storage)
- `[/api/uploads/local] File details` - Uploaded file information
- `[/api/uploads/local] Saving file to local storage:` - File being written
- `[LocalStorage] putObject` - Detailed local storage operations
- `[LocalStorage] File written successfully:` - File write completed
- `[LocalStorage] File verification` - File size and permissions verified

**Files:**
- `src/app/api/r2/sign/route.ts` - Upload credential generation
- `src/app/api/uploads/local/route.ts` - Local file upload handler
- `src/lib/local-storage.ts` - Local filesystem operations

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Failed to upload featured image" Error

**Symptoms:**
- Error message when saving post with featured image
- Featured image doesn't appear on published post

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check logs for `[createPost] Error uploading featured image:` or `[updatePost] Error uploading featured image:`
2. Look for preceding logs showing storage method chosen
3. Check file details (size, type) in error log

**Common Causes:**
- **Permission denied (local storage):** Upload directory not writable
- **S3/R2 credentials invalid:** Cloud storage configuration incorrect
- **File too large:** Exceeds 5MB limit for featured images
- **Invalid file type:** Not in allowed list (jpeg, png, webp, gif)

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check directory permissions (local storage)
ls -la public/uploads/featured/
# Should show drwxr-xr-x or similar (755)

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod -R 755 public/uploads/
chown -R <your-app-user>:<your-app-group> public/uploads/

# Verify directory exists
mkdir -p public/uploads/featured/

# Check S3/R2 environment variables (cloud storage)
echo $S3_ENDPOINT
echo $S3_REGION
echo $S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# (Don't echo SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in production!)
```

### Issue 2: Editor Images Not Uploading

**Symptoms:**
- Drag/drop does nothing
- Image button uploads but image doesn't appear
- Console errors in browser

**Diagnosis:**
1. Open browser DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Try uploading an image
3. Check for failed requests to `/api/r2/sign` or `/api/uploads/local`
4. Check server logs for corresponding API route errors

**Common Causes:**
- **Missing upload configuration:** Database config values not set
- **Directory permissions (local):** Cannot write to `public/uploads/images/`
- **S3/R2 CORS:** Cloud storage not configured for browser uploads
- **Session/auth issue:** User not properly authenticated

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Verify upload configuration in database
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT key, value FROM configurations WHERE key LIKE 'UPLOADS.%';"

# Expected values:
# UPLOADS.IMAGE-MAX-BYTES: 10485760 (10MB)
# UPLOADS.VIDEO-MAX-BYTES: 104857600 (100MB)
# UPLOADS.VIDEO-MAX-DURATION-SECONDS: 120
# UPLOADS.ALLOWED-MIME-IMAGE: ["image/jpeg","image/png","image/gif","image/webp"]
# UPLOADS.ALLOWED-MIME-VIDEO: ["video/mp4","video/webm"]

# Seed default config if missing
pnpm seed:config

# Check directory structure and permissions
ls -la public/uploads/
# Should have: images/, videos/, featured/ subdirectories

# Create directories if missing
mkdir -p public/uploads/{images,videos,featured}
chmod -R 755 public/uploads/
```

### Issue 3: Uploads Work Locally But Fail in Production

**Symptoms:**
- Everything works in development
- Same operations fail in production/Docker

**Common Causes:**
- **Volume mounts not configured:** Docker container can't persist files
- **Different user/permissions:** Production runs as different user than development
- **Environment variables missing:** S3/R2 config not set in production

**Solutions for Docker:**

Check your `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose.prod.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    # ... other config ...
    volumes:
      # REQUIRED for local storage
      - ./public/uploads:/app/public/uploads
    environment:
      # If using S3/R2, ensure these are set
      - S3_ENDPOINT=${S3_ENDPOINT}
      - S3_REGION=${S3_REGION}
      - S3_BUCKET=${S3_BUCKET}
      - S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
      - S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
      # Optional: R2-specific
      - R2_PUBLIC_URL=${R2_PUBLIC_URL}
```

Check file ownership in container:

```bash
# Enter container
docker exec -it <container-name> sh

# Check user running the app
id

# Check upload directory ownership
ls -la /app/public/uploads/

# Fix ownership if needed (as root)
chown -R node:node /app/public/uploads/
```

### Issue 4: Images Upload But Don't Display

**Symptoms:**
- Upload succeeds (no errors)
- Image URL is saved in database
- Image doesn't load on published post (404 or broken)

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check the `featuredImageUrl` value in database
2. Try accessing the URL directly in browser
3. Check server logs for 404 errors
4. Inspect HTML source to see actual URL rendered

**Common Causes:**
- **Wrong public URL (S3/R2):** `R2_PUBLIC_URL` or public URL configuration incorrect
- **File not accessible:** Permissions prevent reading
- **CDN/proxy issue:** Reverse proxy not configured to serve `/uploads/`

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check database value
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT id, title, \"featuredImageUrl\" FROM posts WHERE \"featuredImageUrl\" IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;"

# For local storage - verify file exists
ls -la public/uploads/featured/

# For S3/R2 - verify public access
# Check bucket CORS and public access settings in your provider dashboard

# For reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy) - ensure static files served
# Example Caddyfile snippet:
# handle /uploads/* {
#   root * /app/public
#   file_server
# }

# Example nginx snippet:
# location /uploads/ {
#   root /app/public;
# }
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

Set environment variable:

```bash
# In .env or docker-compose.yml
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

This enables detailed logging at all checkpoints:
- File reception and validation
- Storage method selection (S3/R2 vs local)
- Directory creation and permissions
- File write operations
- Database tracking
- Success/failure with full context

## Best Practices

1. **Always use volume mounts in Docker** for persistent storage
2. **Set proper permissions** on upload directories (755 for directories, 644 for files)
3. **Enable debug logging** when troubleshooting
4. **Monitor disk space** - uploads can accumulate quickly
5. **Use S3/R2 in production** for better scalability and reliability
6. **Test uploads after deployment** as part of smoke testing
7. **Check logs immediately** if upload issues are reported
