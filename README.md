*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

```bash
# 0) Start PostgreSQL database with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d db

# 1) Install project dependencies
pnpm install

# 2) Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# IMPORTANT: Ensure DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, ADMIN_EMAILS, and ANALYTICS_IP_SALT are set.
# Adjust NEXTAUTH_URL and OAuth provider IDs as needed for your environment.

# 3) Run database migrations (create tables)
pnpm drizzle:migrate

# 4) Seed essential configuration defaults
pnpm seed:config

# 5) (Optional) Seed demo posts and comments
pnpm seed:posts

# 6) Start the development server
pnpm dev
# Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

# 7) (First-time setup) Sign in with OAuth and set up 2FA
# - Sign in with GitHub or Google (your email must be in ADMIN_EMAILS)
# - Navigate to /admin/security to enable Two-Factor Authentication
# - Choose TOTP (authenticator app) or Passkey (biometric/hardware key)
```

> üí° **Manual DB Setup:** If you prefer a manual PostgreSQL instance, update `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file and skip the `docker compose up -d db` step.
> 
> üîê **Admin Access:** Only emails listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS` can access the admin dashboard at `/admin`. After first login, you'll be prompted to set up Two-Factor Authentication for enhanced security.

---


## üíæ Data Operations

Navravo ships with first-class data lifecycle tooling powered by Drizzle and S3-compatible manifests, accessible via both CLI scripts and the Admin UI at `/admin/data-operations`.

### Export & Backup
- **Full Backups:** `pnpm backup` creates a ZIP archive with JSON table exports, manifest hashes, and (optionally) media references.
- **Audit Friendly:** Commands log counts, checksum data, and skip reasons to aid compliance reviews.
- **Admin UI:** Export backups directly from the admin dashboard with progress tracking.

### Restore & Import
- **Selective Restore:** `pnpm restore -- <backup.zip>` supports dry runs, slug/date filters, and skipping users/configuration.
- **Smart Conflict Handling:** Choose how to handle existing content during restore operations.
- **Media Awareness:** Manifests capture attachment URLs and hashes so you can verify remote assets before rehydration.

### Purge Operations
- **Soft Purge:** Remove published posts while preserving drafts, users, and configuration.
- **Hard Purge:** Complete data reset removing all posts, comments, categories, tags, redirects, and uploaded files.
- **Confirmation Required:** All destructive operations require explicit confirmation in the UI.

### Audit Logging
- **Complete Trail:** All data operations (export, restore, purge) are logged with timestamps, user info, and operation details.
- **Compliance Ready:** Detailed audit logs support security reviews and compliance requirements.

```bash
# Create a verbose backup without media payloads
pnpm backup -- --skip-media --verbose

# Preview restore scope for specific slugs before applying changes
pnpm restore -- backups/blog-2025-09-01.zip --dry-run --slugs my-first-post,second-post
```

## üö¢ Deployment

Narravo is designed for flexible deployment. You can host it on your own infrastructure using Docker or deploy it to a serverless platform like Vercel.

*   **Option A: Docker Compose** - A single VM setup using Docker Compose to run the application and database. This is a good option for self-hosting.
*   **Option B: Vercel + Neon** - A serverless setup using Vercel for the application and Neon for the database. This is a good option for a managed, scalable solution.

For detailed deployment instructions, please refer to the [**Production Deployment Guide**](./deploy/README_DEPLOY.md).

## üß± Architecture Overview

- **App Router Layout:** The `src/app` tree separates public routes (`(public)`), authentication (`(auth)`), and admin tooling (`(admin)`), leaning on React Server Components by default. Middleware injects route context and handles legacy redirect resolution at the edge.
- **Domain Modules:** Business logic lives in `src/lib` with clear boundaries for posts, comments, reactions, imports, backups, rate limiting, analytics, 2FA, and configuration. Server Actions validate input with Zod and revalidate cache tags after mutations.
- **Authentication & Security:** Auth.js handles OAuth sessions with admin allowlists. Two-factor authentication (TOTP/WebAuthn) protects admin routes with 8-hour verification windows, trusted device management, and comprehensive audit logging.
- **Data & Configuration:** Drizzle ORM drives the schema (`drizzle/schema.ts`) with migrations and transactions. A Config Service exposes database-backed feature flags (banner, theming, rate limits, render badges, etc.) to both server and client code.
- **Engagement Pipeline:** Comments support nested threads, media attachments, moderation queues, and reaction toggles. Rate limiting, honeypots, media validation, and audit logging protect the workflow.
- **Content Migration:** The WordPress importer coordinates resumable jobs, media rewriting, redirect creation, and excerpt rebuilding from either the Admin UI or CLI scripts.
- **Data Operations:** Export, restore, and purge operations with manifest verification, selective filtering, and audit trails accessible via CLI or admin UI.
- **Observability:** Privacy-aware analytics aggregate daily view counts, power trending widgets, and surface dashboards. Real User Monitoring collects Core Web Vitals, while Server-Timing instrumentation and perf scripts keep regressions in check.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All environment variables are documented in detail within the `.env.example` file. Copy it to `.env` and adjust as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Required Variables:**

*   `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., `postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/narravo`)
*   `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Strong random string for session/JWT encryption (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
*   `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your application's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `https://yourdomain.com`)
*   `ADMIN_EMAILS`: Comma-separated list of emails for admin access (case-insensitive)

**Authentication & Security:**

*   **OAuth Providers:** `GITHUB_ID`, `GITHUB_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_ID`, `GOOGLE_SECRET` (optional but recommended)
*   **Analytics Privacy:** `ANALYTICS_IP_SALT` ‚Äî Salt for hashing IP addresses before persisting view events (strongly recommended)

**Media Storage (Optional):**

Choose one of the following:
*   **AWS S3:** `S3_REGION`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ENDPOINT` (optional for S3-compatible services)
*   **Cloudflare R2:** `R2_REGION`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET`, `R2_ENDPOINT`

If neither is configured, media will be stored locally in the `public/uploads` directory.

**Performance & Observability (Optional):**

*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_RUM_SAMPLING_RATE` ‚Äî Client-side Real User Monitoring sampling rate (default: `0.1` = 10%)
*   `RUM_SAMPLING_RATE` ‚Äî Server-side RUM sampling rate (default: `0.1`)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

Narravo uses Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions and migrations.

*   **Generate Migrations:** Create new migration files based on schema changes.
    ```bash
    pnpm drizzle:generate
    ```
*   **Apply Migrations:** Run pending migrations (production-safe).
    ```bash
    pnpm drizzle:migrate
    ```
*   **Check Migration Status:** Verify which migrations have been applied.
    ```bash
    pnpm drizzle:check
    ```
*   **Sync Migration Tracking:** Fix migration tracking after using `drizzle:push`.
    ```bash
    CONFIRM_MIGRATION_SYNC=yes pnpm drizzle:sync
    ```
*   **Push Schema (Dev Only):** Quickly sync schema during local development.
    ```bash
    pnpm drizzle:push
    ```
*   **Seed Configuration:** Essential for initial setup and default settings.
    ```bash
    pnpm seed:config

## üîÑ WordPress WXR Import

Narravo includes a powerful and resilient WordPress import tool to migrate your content from a WordPress WXR export file.

**Import Capabilities:**

*   **Comprehensive Content:** Imports posts, comments (with threading), categories, and tags.
*   **Flexible Statuses:** Choose which post statuses to import (e.g., `publish`, `draft`).
*   **Media & SEO:** Downloads media to S3/R2, rewrites content URLs, and creates 301 redirects from old WordPress post URLs.
*   **Offline Import Support:** Import media from local uploads directory when original site is offline or unreachable.
*   **Enhanced Purge:** Complete data reset option that removes all posts, comments, categories, tags, redirects, and uploaded files.
*   **Resilient Process:** Features include dry-runs, real-time progress, job cancellation, and detailed error logging.
*   **Admin UI & CLI:** Manage imports through the Admin Dashboard or automate them with a CLI script.

For a complete guide, see the [**WordPress Import Documentation**](./docs/wordpress-import.md).

### CLI Options

The `wxr:import` script supports several command-line flags to customize the import process:

*   `path=<file>`: (Required) The path to your WXR export file.
*   `--verbose`: Enables detailed logging for troubleshooting.
*   `--dry-run`: Simulates the import without making any changes to the database.
*   `--skip-media`: Skips downloading and processing of any media files.
*   `--rebuild-excerpts`: Forces regeneration of excerpts for all posts, even if they already have one.
*   `--purge`: **Deletes all existing posts, comments, tags, categories, redirects, and uploaded files** before starting the import. Use with caution.
*   `uploads=<path>`: Specifies the path to a local folder containing your WordPress `uploads` directory. Use this for offline imports where the original site is not reachable.
*   `root=<pattern>`: A regular expression to match the root URL of your old site (e.g., `^https?://my-old-site.com`). Required when using `uploads`.
*   `allowedHosts=<hosts>`: Comma-separated list of allowed domains for media downloads (e.g., `example.com,cdn.example.com`).
*   `concurrency=<number>`: Number of simultaneous media downloads (1-10, default: 4).

#### Example Offline Import

This command runs an import using a local backup of media files, purging all existing data and files first.

```bash
pnpm wxr:import -- path=./export.xml --purge uploads=/path/to/wp-backup/uploads root='^https?://my-old-site\.com$' --verbose
```

---

## üìä Analytics & Observability

- **Trending & Dashboards:** View aggregation tables power the public "Trending Posts" widget and the `/admin/analytics` dashboard with sparklines, totals, and configurable date windows.
- **Privacy-Aware Metrics:** View events dedupe by session/IP, respect bot filters, and hash IP addresses when `ANALYTICS_IP_SALT` is set.
- **Real User Monitoring:** Drop `<RUMCollector />` into layouts to post Core Web Vitals to `/api/rum`. Control sampling with `NEXT_PUBLIC_RUM_SAMPLING_RATE` (client) and `RUM_SAMPLING_RATE` (server), both defaulting to 10%.
- **Performance Instrumentation:** Middleware adds Server-Timing headers, and the config flag `VIEW.PUBLIC-SHOW-RENDER-BADGE` surfaces render times in the UI. Perf scripts (`perf:*`) automate Lighthouse, bundle analysis, and load testing‚Äîsee [`docs/perf/README.md`](./docs/perf/README.md).
- **Weekly Rollups & Benchmarks:** Use `pnpm perf:benchmark` or `pnpm perf:weekly` to archive reports in `docs/perf/` and catch regressions early.

---

## üßë About Me Sidebar

An optional About Me section can appear in the public sidebar.

- Enable/disable: SITE.ABOUT-ME.ENABLED (boolean)
- Title: SITE.ABOUT-ME.TITLE (string)
- Content: SITE.ABOUT-ME.CONTENT (string)

You can manage these in the Admin Dashboard:

- Navigate to Admin -> System -> About Me
- Toggle enable, edit the title and content, then Save Changes

When enabled, the About Me section renders above the Recent posts list.

---

## üîê Security

- **Sanitized Content:** All HTML passes through DOMPurify allowlists before storage/rendering, and markdown editors sanitize on save.
- **Strict Headers:** CSP, HSTS, Referrer-Policy, and X-Content-Type-Options are enabled via Next config and middleware defaults.
- **Rate Limiting & Abuse Controls:** Shared helpers cap comment/reaction/import rates, enforce submission delays, and add honeypots.
- **Safe Media Handling:** Attachments validate MIME types, file signatures, byte limits, and generate poster images for videos.
- **Privacy Respecting Analytics:** View tracking dedupes sessions, hashes IPs with `ANALYTICS_IP_SALT`, and honors DNT where possible.
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** Admin routes protected with 2FA enforcement, with 8-hour verification windows and secure session management.
