# Migration System Implementation - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Migration Runner (`scripts/migrate.ts`)
- Uses Drizzle's official `migrate()` function
- Applies migrations sequentially from `drizzle/migrations/`
- Production-safe and idempotent
- Proper error handling

### 2. Updated package.json
- Added `"drizzle:migrate": "tsx scripts/migrate.ts"` command
- `drizzle:push` remains available for local development

### 3. Updated Production Deployment (`deploy/entrypoint.sh`)
- Changed from `npx drizzle-kit push` (❌ dev tool) 
- To `npm run drizzle:migrate` (✅ production-safe)
- Now fails fast if migrations error (instead of continuing)

### 4. Updated Documentation (`README.md`)
- Quick Start now uses `drizzle:migrate`
- Database Management section clarifies:
  - `drizzle:migrate` for production
  - `drizzle:push` for local development only
- Commands table updated with both options

### 5. Created Upgrade Guide (`docs/UPGRADING_FROM_0.5.md`)
- Step-by-step instructions for users on 0.5.0
- Lists all schema changes (migrations 0015, 0016, 0017)
- Troubleshooting for common issues
- Manual migration steps if needed

## What This Fixes

### The Original Problem
Production databases on v0.5.0 were missing schema changes from v0.6.0+ because:
1. `drizzle:push` is a dev tool that compares schemas and applies changes
2. It doesn't use migration files
3. Complex changes (like composite primary keys) can fail
4. No migration history tracking

### The Solution
Now production uses proper Drizzle migrations:
1. Migrations applied sequentially from files
2. Drizzle tracks which migrations have run
3. Idempotent - safe to run multiple times
4. Follows database migration best practices

## For Users Upgrading from 0.5.0

### Simple Case (Fresh Install or No Custom Changes)
```bash
git pull
pnpm install
pnpm drizzle:migrate  # Applies migrations 0015, 0016, 0017
```

### Complex Case (Modified Production Schema)
If `drizzle:migrate` fails, see `docs/UPGRADING_FROM_0.5.md` for:
- How to check which migrations have run
- Manual migration application
- Fixing junction table schema issues
- Starting fresh if needed

## Testing the Changes

### Local Test
```bash
# In development
pnpm drizzle:migrate
# Should apply any pending migrations
```

### Production Test
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
# Check logs for "✅ All migrations applied successfully"
```

## Development Workflow

### Schema Changes
```bash
# 1. Edit schema
vim drizzle/schema.ts

# 2. Generate migration
pnpm drizzle:generate

# 3. Review SQL
cat drizzle/migrations/XXXX.sql

# 4. Apply locally
pnpm drizzle:push    # Quick iteration
# OR
pnpm drizzle:migrate # Production-like

# 5. Commit both schema and migration
git add drizzle/
```

### Production Deployment
Migrations run automatically via `entrypoint.sh`:
1. Container starts
2. `npm run drizzle:migrate` runs
3. If successful, Next.js starts
4. If migrations fail, container exits

## What Schema Changes Were Added

### v0.6.0 (Migration 0015)
- Two-factor authentication tables and columns
- `users.two_factor_enabled`
- `users.two_factor_enforced_at`
- Tables: `owner_totp`, `owner_recovery_code`, `owner_webauthn_credential`, `trusted_device`, `security_activity`

### v0.6.1 (Migration 0016)
- `users.mfa_verified_at` column

### v0.6.2 (Migration 0017)
- Composite primary keys for `post_tags` (post_id, tag_id)
- Composite primary keys for `comment_tags` (comment_id, tag_id)

## Files Changed

```
modified:   README.md                    (documentation updates)
modified:   deploy/entrypoint.sh         (use drizzle:migrate)
modified:   package.json                 (add drizzle:migrate script)
new file:   docs/UPGRADING_FROM_0.5.md   (upgrade guide)
new file:   scripts/migrate.ts           (migration runner)
```

## Commit Message

```
feat: implement proper database migrations for production

BREAKING CHANGE: Production deployments now use drizzle:migrate
instead of drizzle:push.

Changes:
- Add scripts/migrate.ts using Drizzle's official migrate() API
- Add pnpm drizzle:migrate command
- Update deploy/entrypoint.sh to use migrations
- Update README with proper migration workflow
- Add docs/UPGRADING_FROM_0.5.md for users on v0.5.0

Migration path:
- New installations: pnpm drizzle:migrate creates all tables
- Upgrading from 0.5.0: See docs/UPGRADING_FROM_0.5.md
- Migrations 0015, 0016, 0017 will be applied automatically

Benefits:
- Production-safe migration system
- Migration history tracking
- Idempotent operations
- Follows Drizzle best practices
```

## Next Steps

1. Test locally: `pnpm drizzle:migrate`
2. Review changes: `git diff`
3. Commit: Use the commit message above
4. Tag release: `git tag v0.6.3`
5. Deploy and verify migrations run successfully

## Notes

- `drizzle:push` is still available for local dev
- Existing migration files (0000-0017) remain unchanged
- Future schema changes follow the same pattern
- Migration system is now production-ready
